yesod-purescript
================

Work in progress integration of PureScript (purescript.org) into Yesod.


Goals:

- environment for easy PureScript development (with dev flag):
  - per-request compilation of sources,
  - convenient display of error messages.
- a way of embedding compiled PureScript into final app binary using
  TemplateHaskell.
